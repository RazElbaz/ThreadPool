"The Tortoise and the Hare":

Once upon a time, there was a speedy hare who loved to boast about his speed. He would often make fun of the slow and steady tortoise. One day, the tortoise grew tired of the hare's taunting and challenged him to a race.

The hare, confident in his speed, laughed and accepted the challenge without hesitation. They decided on a route and a finish line, and the race began.

As the race started, the hare quickly dashed ahead, leaving the tortoise far behind. Feeling overconfident, the hare decided to take a nap under a shady tree, thinking that he had plenty of time to win.

Meanwhile, the tortoise plodded along steadily, taking one step at a time, never giving up. He saw the sleeping hare and continued on, ignoring the hare's snores.

When the hare woke up and realized the tortoise was nearing the finish line, he sprinted as fast as he could. But it was too late. The tortoise had already crossed the finish line, winning the race.

The moral of the story is that slow and steady wins the race. It's not always the fastest or most talented who succeed, but those who persevere and keep going.
