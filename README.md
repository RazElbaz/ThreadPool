# Introduction:
  
The goal is to implement a threadpool mechanism, and implement syncronization.


# The task in details:   
All the files given to me are in the ```threadPoolTask``` folder.  
I was given a shared library (SO), compiled for x86, with two functions: "encode" and "decode".
A simple basic_main is also included to demonstrate the functionality of the library.
Since the encryption algorithm is done by a novice student, it will take 5ms for each char, which is not
Capable of handling more than 1k (1024) bytes of data. More than that will be ignored.
I had to implement a CMD TOOL that would use the algorithm above.
By the cmd tool we mean, that my executable will receive its work data from stdIn, and put the output to stdOut.


My tools will take input in sdtIn and write the encrypted/decrypted data to stdOut.
"-e" and "-d" flags will be used for encryption and decryption accordingly.

# Example of use:
 ```./coder 2 -e < myfile.txt > encripted_file.txt```   
 ```./coder 2 -d < encripted_file.txt  > test.txt ```  
```./coder 2 -e < myfile.txt > encripted_file.txt```  
```./coder 2 -d < encripted_file.txt  > check.txt```  
```cat encripted_file.txt | ./coder 2 -d > your_original_file.txt```
